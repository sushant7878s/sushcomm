<p class="second"><b>I completed my class 10 and 12 from the same cbse school with 76% and 71% respectively.<BR> Several times i have taken part in school elocution and debate.<br>  I love reading and writing. The time of the day i spend reading is my favourite time .<BR>During my college years i learned few coding languages. Though i came across HTML once but never it happened that i needed to make a project using it , but this time it did and i enjoyed the process of learning and applying simultaneously.Thus now i believe i can perform under pressure equally well.Once out of curiosity i also learned android development and tried to make an app of my own.<br></b></p>
